[Software Engineering Takes on New Meaning in the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://digitally.cognizant.com/software-engineering-takes-on-new-meaning-in-the-covid-19-pandemic-codex5676/)

## My thoughts

What this article suggested about the trend of Software Engineering is inspiring, especially the term "Software Product Engineering". I agree that he role of product owner will expand because the developing process is now customer and market-oriented, and the stakeholder is the mass public. So the developing workflow need to become more flexible and easier to adjust. Under this trend, I guess that each developing cycle may need to be shortened as well, since the development team need to promptly react to customers' feedback and release new solutions. This can make Software Development/Engineering a even more fast-paced field.
